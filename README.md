# goodtorch

Merely a flashlight that uses ray casting.

[Original](https://content.minetest.net/packages/LissoBone/goodtorch/)

Thanks to [LissoBone](https://content.minetest.net/users/LissoBone/) for the idea, initial code, and the fun time with their mod.

## What's different

* Supports water nodes (`aquatic` update v1.2, oh which is the current version, :P)
* Toggling flashlight via right or left clicks (doesn't matter, they both work at toggling the flashlight on and/or off)
* A little codebase rework for a better future.

## What's next (Planning}

* Possible MineClone and NodeCore support (at least their water nodes, MineClone we will make a recipe too, but not for NodeCore as they have unconventional crafting methods, accepting PRs for NC)
* Possible other mod support (as they come and go)
* Possible making it behave more like the Technic's flashlight working still just need it on and in the hotbar. (possibly comming next)
